## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In this project, we designed an intelligent chatbot called ‘SIA Assist’, that
can be primarily used to obtain information on all aspects of Singapore’s Changi Airport in a more efficient and responsive way that accommodates for differences in syntax of questioning grammar but is still able to return a relevant response based on keywords in the query via Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Our proposed chatbot shows true effectiveness when the system has access to user’s travel
information so that his responses can be personalised - either by integrating the chatbot with
an airline application or obtaining his travel information in some other form.

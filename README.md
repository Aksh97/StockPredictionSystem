## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


We began by getting a good understanding of the overall key processes of the proposed solution by mapping them out with data acquisition modelling. Next, we determined the areas which needed targeting that we agreed should be implemented into business processes. We also made sure we analysed the processes with our improvements and see how these improvements were handled with test cases to validate our assumptions.

Our primary objective is to enable a user to understand the historical stock prices and provide him the visibility into the movement of the stock prices for the following day. For this project, we have considered companies from the NASDAQ 100 Stock List.
